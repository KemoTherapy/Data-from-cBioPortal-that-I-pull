# Data-from-cBioPortal-that-I-pull
Testing if this needs to be public for me to pull from it in RStudio using read_csv

This repository will consist of data that I pull from cbioportal

For now: 
- I will be simply downloading the data that I want directly off the website
- I will upload it into files here and most likely use the "readcsv" function and the raw data in RStudio in order to have the data on my system and have it available to anyone that has my code

Later: 
- I will hopefully make an algorithm that scrapes the data automatically and turns into a csv file in this repository
